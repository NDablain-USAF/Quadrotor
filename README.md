Modeling, design, and implementation of an autonomous quadrotor using a mix of optimal and classical control. The inertial position and attitude implement the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) for an optimal estimator and regulator. The motor is controlled with a Lead/Lag compensator designed through system identification.
