Modeling, design, and implementation of an autonomous quadrotor using a mix of optimal and classical control. The inertial position and attitude implement the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) for an optimal estimator and regulator. The motor is controlled with a Lead/Lag compensator designed through system identification. Modeling and design work is performed in Matlab/SIMULINK under folder "Design". Implementation is done on Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller using C/C++. See Wiki tab for detailed view on components and design.
